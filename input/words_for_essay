Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase Each bookcase has six shelves going almost to the ceiling Some bookshelves are stacked to the brim with hardback books science maths history and everything else Other shelves have two layers of paperback science fiction with the back layer of books propped up on old tissue boxes or lengths of wood so that you can see the back layer of books above the books in front And it still isnt enough Books are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and making little heaps under the windows

This is the livingroom of the house occupied by the eminent Professor Michael VerresEvans and his wife Mrs Petunia EvansVerres and their adopted son Harry James PotterEvansVerres

There is a letter lying on the livingroom table and an unstamped envelope of yellowish parchment addressed to Mr H Potter in emeraldgreen ink

The Professor and his wife are speaking sharply at each other but they are not shouting The Professor considers shouting to be uncivilised

Youre joking Michael said to Petunia His tone indicated that he was very much afraid that she was serious

My sister was a witch Petunia repeated She looked frightened but stood her ground Her husband was a wizard

This is absurd Michael said sharply They were at our wedding  they visited for Christmas 

I told them you werent to know Petunia whispered But its true Ive seen things 

The Professor rolled his eyes Dear I understand that youre not familiar with the sceptical literature You may not realise how easy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons If it seemed like they could always guess what you were thinking thats called cold reading 

It wasnt bending spoons 

What was it then

Petunia bit her lip I cant just tell you Youll think Im  She swallowed Listen Michael I wasnt  always like this  She gestured at herself as though to indicate her lithe form Lily did this Because I  because I begged her For years I begged her Lily had always been prettier than me and Id been mean to her because of that and then she got magic can you imagine how I felt And I begged her to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too even if I couldnt have her magic at least I could be pretty

Tears were gathering in Petunias eyes

And Lily would tell me no and make up the most ridiculous excuses like the world would end if she were nice to her sister or a centaur told her not to  the most ridiculous things and I hated her for it And when I had just graduated from university I was going out with this boy Vernon Dursley he was fat and he was the only boy who would talk to me And he said he wanted children and that his first son would be named Dudley And I thought to myself what kind of parent names their child Dudley Dursley It was like I saw my whole future life stretching out in front of me and I couldnt stand it And I wrote to my sister and told her that if she didnt help me Id rather just 

Petunia stopped

Anyway Petunia said her voice small she gave in She told me it was dangerous and I said I didnt care any more and I drank this potion and I was sick for weeks but when I got better my skin cleared up and I finally filled out and I was beautiful people were nice to me her voice broke and after that I couldnt hate my sister any more especially when I learned what her magic brought her in the end 

Darling Michael said gently you got sick you gained some weight while resting in bed and your skin cleared up on its own Or being sick made you change your diet 

She was a witch Petunia repeated I saw it

Petunia Michael said The annoyance was creeping into his voice You know that cant be true Do I really have to explain why

Petunia wrung her hands She seemed to be on the verge of tears My love I know I cant win arguments with you but please you have to trust me on this 

Dad Mum

The two of them stopped and looked at Harry as though theyd forgotten there was a third person in the room

Harry took a deep breath Mum your parents didnt have magic did they

No Petunia said looking puzzled

Then no one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her letter How did they get convinced

Ah Petunia said They didnt just send a letter They sent a professor from Hogwarts He  Petunias eyes flicked to Michael He showed us some magic

Then you dont have to fight over this Harry said firmly Hoping against hope that this time just this once they would listen to him If its true we can just get a Hogwarts professor here and see the magic for ourselves and Dad will admit that its true And if not then Mum will admit that its false Thats what the experimental method is for so that we dont have to resolve things just by arguing

The Professor turned and looked down at him dismissive as usual Oh come now Harry Really magic I thought youd know better than to take this seriously son even if youre only ten Magic is just about the most unscientific thing there is

Harrys mouth twisted bitterly He was treated well probably better than most genetic fathers treated their own children Harry had been sent to the best primary schools  and when that didnt work out he was provided with tutors from the endless pool of starving students Always Harry had been encouraged to study whatever caught his attention bought all the books that caught his fancy sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he entered He was given anything reasonable that he wanted except maybe the slightest shred of respect A Doctor teaching biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the advice of a little boy You would listen to Show Interest of course thats what a Good Parent would do and so if you conceived of yourself as a Good Parent you would do it But take a tenyearold seriously Hardly

Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father

Mum Harry said If you want to win this argument with Dad look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics Theres a quote there about how philosophers say a great deal about what science absolutely requires and it is all wrong because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is observation  that you just have to look at the world and report what you see Um off the top of my head I cant think of where to find something about how its an ideal of science to settle things by experiment instead of arguments 

His mother looked down at him and smiled Thank you Harry But  her head rose back up to stare at her husband I dont want to win an argument with your father I want my husband to to listen to his wife who loves him and trust her just this once 

Harry closed his eyes briefly Hopeless Both of his parents were just hopeless

Now his parents were getting into one of those arguments again one where his mother tried to make his father feel guilty and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid

Im going to go to my room Harry announced His voice trembled a little Please try not to fight too much about this Mum Dad well know soon enough how it comes out right

Of course Harry said his father and his mother gave him a reassuring kiss and then they went on fighting while Harry climbed the stairs to his bedroom

He shut the door behind him and tried to think

The funny thing was he should have agreed with Dad No one had ever seen any evidence of magic and according to Mum there was a whole magical world out there How could anyone keep something like that a secret More magic That seemed like a rather suspicious sort of excuse

It should have been a clean case for Mum joking lying or being insane in ascending order of awfulness If Mum had sent the letter herself that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without a stamp A little insanity was far far less improbable than the universe really working like that

Except that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic was real and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry

Harry rubbed his forehead grimacing Dont believe everything you think one of his books had said

But this bizarre certainty Harry was finding himself just expecting that yes a Hogwarts professor would show up and wave a wand and magic would come out The strange certainty was making no effort to guard itself against falsification  wasnt making excuses in advance for why there wouldnt be a professor or the professor would only be able to bend spoons

Where do you come from strange little prediction Harry directed the thought at his brain Why do I believe what I believe

Usually Harry was pretty good at answering that question but in this particular case he had no clue what his brain was thinking

Harry mentally shrugged A flat metal plate on a door affords pushing and a handle on a door affords pulling and the thing to do with a testable hypothesis is to go and test it

He took a piece of lined paper from his desk and started writing

Dear Deputy Headmistress

Harry paused reflecting then discarded the paper for another tapping another millimetre of graphite from his mechanical pencil This called for careful calligraphy

Dear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall

Or Whomsoever It May Concern

I recently received your letter of acceptance to Hogwarts addressed to Mr H Potter You may not be aware that my genetic parents James Potter and Lily Potter formerly Lily Evans are dead I was adopted by Lilys sister Petunia EvansVerres and her husband Michael VerresEvans

I am extremely interested in attending Hogwarts conditional on such a place actually existing Only my mother Petunia says she knows about magic and she cant use it herself My father is highly sceptical I myself am uncertain I also dont know where to obtain any of the books or equipment listed in your acceptance letter

Mother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to Lily Potter then Lily Evans in order to demonstrate to her family that magic was real and I presume help Lily obtain her school materials If you could do this for my own family it would be extremely helpful

Sincerely

Harry James PotterEvansVerres

Harry added their current address then folded up the letter and put it in an envelope which he addressed to Hogwarts Further consideration led him to obtain a candle and drip wax onto the flap of the envelope into which using a penknifes tip he impressed the initials HJPEV If he was going to descend into this madness he was going to do it with style

Then he opened his door and went back downstairs His father was sitting in the livingroom and reading a book of higher maths to show how smart he was and his mother was in the kitchen preparing one of his fathers favourite meals to show how loving she was It didnt look like they were talking to one another at all As scary as arguments could be not arguing was somehow much worse

Mum Harry said into the unnerving silence Im going to test the hypothesis According to your theory how do I send an owl to Hogwarts

His mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him looking shocked I  I dont know I think you just have to own a magic owl

That shouldve sounded highly suspicious oh so theres no way to test your theory then but the peculiar certainty in Harry seemed willing to stick its neck out even further

Well the letter got here somehow Harry said so Ill just wave it around outside and call letter for Hogwarts and see if an owl picks it up Dad do you want to come and watch

His father shook his head minutely and kept on reading Of course Harry thought to himself Magic was a disgraceful thing that only stupid people believed in if his father went so far as to test the hypothesis or even watch it being tested that would feel like associating himself with that

Only as Harry stumped out the back door into the back garden did it occur to him that if an owl did come down and snatch the letter he was going to have some trouble telling Dad about it

But  well  that cant really happen can it No matter what my brain seems to believe If an owl really comes down and grabs this envelope Im going to have worries a lot more important than what Dad thinks

Harry took a deep breath and raised the envelope into the air

He swallowed

Calling out Letter for Hogwarts while holding an envelope high in the air in the middle of your own back garden was actually pretty embarrassing now that he thought about it

No Im better than Dad I will use the scientific method even if it makes me feel stupid

Letter  Harry said but it actually came out as more of a whispered croak

Harry steeled his will and shouted into the empty sky Letter for Hogwarts Can I get an owl

Harry asked a bemused womans voice one of the neighbours

Harry pulled down his hand like it was on fire and hid the envelope behind his back like it was drug money His whole face was hot with shame

An old womans face peered out from above the neighbouring fence grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet Mrs Figg the occasional babysitter What are you doing Harry

Nothing Harry said in a strangled voice Just  testing a really silly theory 

Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts

Harry froze in place

Yes Harrys lips said a little while later I got a letter from Hogwarts They say they want my owl by the st of July but 

But you dont have an owl Poor dear I cant imagine what someone must have been thinking sending you just the standard letter

A wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence and opened an expectant hand Hardly even thinking at this point Harry gave over his envelope

Just leave it to me dear said Mrs Figg and in a jiffy or two Ill have someone over

And her face disappeared from over the fence

There was a long silence in the garden

Then a boys voice said calmly and quietly What
